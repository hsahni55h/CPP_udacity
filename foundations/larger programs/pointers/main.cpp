/* Accessing a Memory Address
Each variable in a program stores its contents in the computer's memory, and each chunk of the memory has an address number. 
For a given variable, the memory address can be accessed using an ampersand in front of the variable. 
*/

#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() {
    int i = 5;
    int j = 6;
    
    // Print the memory addresses of i and j
    cout << "The address of i is: " << &i << "\n";
    cout << "The address of j is: " << &j << "\n";
}

/* Storing a Memory Address (int type)
Once a memory address is accessed, you can store it using a pointer. 
A pointer can be declared by using the * operator in the declaration.
*/

#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() 
{
    int i = 5;
    // A pointer pointer_to_i is declared and initialized to the address of i.
    int* pointer_to_i = &i;
    
    // Print the memory addresses of i and j
    cout << "The address of i is:          " << &i << "\n";
    cout << "The variable pointer_to_i is: " << pointer_to_i << "\n";
}

/* Getting an Object Back from a Pointer Address
Once you have a pointer, you may want to retrieve the object it is pointing to. 
In this case, the * symbol can be used again. 
This time, however, it will appear on the right hand side of an equation or in front of an already-defined variable, 
so the meaning is different. 
In this case, it is called the "dereferencing operator", and it returns the object being pointed to.
